#cannelloni
*a SocketCAN over Ethernet tunnel*

cannelloni is written in C++11 and uses UDP to transfer CAN frames
between two machines.

Features:

- frame aggregation in UDP frames (multiple CAN frames in one UDP
  frame)
- efficient protocol
- very high data rates possible (40 Mbit/s +)
- custom timeouts for certain IDs (see below)
- easy debugging

Not yet supported (send a PR ;) ):

- CAN_FD
- Resend lost UDP frames
- Packet loss detection

##Compilation

cannelloni uses cmake to generate a Makefile.
You can build cannelloni using the following command.

```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make
```

##Installation

Just install it using

```
  make install
```

##Usage

###Example

Two machines A and B need to be connected:

![](doc/firstexp.png)

Machine 2 needs to be connected to the physical CAN Bus that is attached
to Machine 1.

Start cannelloni on Machine 1:

```
cannelloni -I slcan0 -R 192.168.0.3 -r 20000 -l 20000
```
cannelloni will now listen on port 20000 and has Machine 2 configured as
its remote.

Prepare vcan on Machine 2:

```
sudo modprobe vcan
sudo ip link add name vcan0 type vcan
sudo ip link set dev vcan0 up
```

Now start cannelloni on Machine 2:
```
cannelloni -I vcan0 -R 192.168.0.2 -r 20000 -l 20000
```

The tunnel is now complete and can be used on both machines. Simply try
it by using `candump` and/or `cangen`.

If something does not work, try the debug switch `-d cut` to find out
what is wrong.

###Timeouts

cannelloni either sends a full UDP frame or whatever it gots when
the timeout that has been specified by the `-t` flag is reached.
The default value is 100000 us, so the worst case latency for any can
frame is

```
Lw ~= 100ms + Ethernet latency + Delay on Receiver
```

If you have high priority frames but you also want a small ethernet 
overhead, you can create a csv in the format
```
CAN_ID,Timeout in us
```
to specify these frames. You can use the `#` character to comment your
frames.

For example, if the frames with the IDs 5 and 15 should be send after
a shorter timeout you can create a file with the following content.

```
# 15ms
5,15000
# 50ms
15,50000
```

You can load this file into each cannelloni instance with the `-T
file.csv` option.
Please note that the whole buffer will be flushed and not only the two
frames.

If you enable timer debugging using `-d t` you should see that the table
has been loaded successfully into cannelloni:
